Comments about solution: We didn't utilize a pointer for our classic, mirror, and doughnut mode. We used brute code instead. In addition, when we both worked on mirror mode, we did not need to make a new header file for donut,classic,mirror mode. 
Jon's contribution: donut.cpp, and both of us worked on mirror mode, main.cpp. 
Debbie Lu's contribution: classic.cpp, board.h, worked on mirror mode, main.cpp together
